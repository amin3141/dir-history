seek the protection of the Amir, the king of Afghanistan.

The king asked his Commander-in-Chief Ghulam Haidar Khan to
construct a road to Bin Shahi to link Dir so as to envade Umara
Khan and reinstall Mohammad Sharif Khan as Khan of Dir. This was
the time when a defined demarcation line had not been established
between Afghanistan and the area constituting now the borders of
Pakistan. The Afghan king would keep two platoons of National Army
in Bajaur and Mohmana to protect the Frontiers of the country from
any possible threat from this side.

The General, Ghulam Haidar Khan requested the king that they
had been spending huge amount just to upkeep a dry barren land
(Bajaur) which was an unfruitful expensive exercise. The Amir of
Afghanistan had already been requested by the British to allow
Bajaur to their possession in return of Rs.1,800,000. Having
agreed on the terms a British Officer named Dewrand signed for the
British and Mohammad Umar Khan son of Ghulam Haidar Khan signed as
representative of the Afghan Govt. and thus the Dewrand line was

established.

Khan of Nawagai for some time. Therefrom he went to Peshawar via
Mohamand Agency and stayed as guest with Arbab Fareed Khan of
Tehkal for a few weeks. He then came to Swat via Palai Sher Khani

Rs.6,000.00. The local people gave him "Pan Chakies", and "Pekos"

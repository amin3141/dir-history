. Umara Khan S/O Aman Khan son of Feztalab Khan were the
escendants of a Saintly person known as Mast Baba. The dynasty 1S
called as Mast Khel after his name.

The original place of birth of Mast Baba is Swara Ghundai
near Sadbar Killi in Jandool. A powerful man Subedar Mir Alam Khan
was ruling the tribes of Bajaur by that time on behalf of the Govt
in Delhi. The Salarzai tribe of Bajaur had an upper hand on the
people of Jandool and they would keep them pressed every time. On
the request of the people of Jandool, the Chief of Bajaur, Mir Alam
Khan made a demarcation of the area between the tribes of Salarzai
(Bajaur) and Mast Khel of Jandool. Batwar was given to Salarzai,
the upper Barawal was declared as part of Jandool and lower Barawal
as part of Maidan. A spot called Daky Warbaza was identified as
boundary between the upper and lower Barawal.

By this time Muhammad Zaman Khan the brother of Umara Khan was
the Khan of Barwa (Samar Bagh). His mother lived with him.
Mohammad Zaman Khan had exiled Umara Khan and the other brother
Mohammad Shah Khan from Jandool and they lived at Swal Qila in
Bajaur. They had a miserable life there. One day Umara Khan
gathered his family members around the hearth and told them that
the next day they would find him either as the conqueror of Barwa
or they woulda see his dead body for burial.

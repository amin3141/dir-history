These are some of the factors that are responsible for
hindrances in a quick progress in the agriculture field.

The holdings are so small and the per unit yield are too low
to fulfill the requirements of the farmer. Therefore the farmers
have to depend on alternate jobs along with agriculture, if he is

able to find one.

The farmer in some parts of the district mostly in the eastern
valleys has, out of necessity been cultivating Poppy so as to get
hand some return from the small, otherwise less productive piece of
land. The department of Agriculture has not been able to give any
substitute crop for poppy and probably there 1s no hope in future
that the crop could be replaced. â€” Comparative cost of production
and income from different conventional crops are given here which
would give a clear picture about the situation.
